Buttons seem to be a valiant step on the way to figuring out touch input controls. 
As buttons work by default for touch and mouse controls, it is easy to directly use 
the button's generic OnClick() Method. The downside is that this doesn't account for
the button's "pressed" state, as sound only comes out after releasing the button.
We can hopefully find a similar way online and be able to come up with a quick solution.
