Unity has a built in Touch property akin to its Input properties.
A tap and mouse click are very similar with how they can be used, but the syntax varies wildly.

Linked below are references to Unity's documented features which should be studied by anyone wanting to partake in Touch functionality. Every touch the game recognizes is added to a list of touches, this allows for useful functions. For example, you can choose the first touch recorded that frame, or get a count of how many touches occured. An important feature is the ability to return a touch inputs position on screen. This would allow us to create a button system that does not use Unity's built in system. 

A valuable part of Unity's Touch functionality is the built in TouchPhase enum that handles a touch's beginning, middle, and end. These are vital to PianoVs. Using the touch phases we can determine if we need to play a single note shortly as if a piano key was tapped,
if we need to play a note for an extended period of time as if it was held down, or if the player is performing a "glissando".
